## Features

<!-- List your awesome features here -->

## Installation

To install your project, you must choose the method appropriate to your version of Volto.


### Volto 17 and earlier

Create a new Volto project (you can skip this step if you already have one):

```
npm install -g yo @plone/generator-volto
yo @plone/volto my-volto-project --addon aurora-project-title
cd my-volto-project
```

Add `aurora-project-title` to your package.json:

```JSON
"addons": [
    "aurora-project-title"
],

"dependencies": {
    "aurora-project-title": "*"
}
```

Download and install the new add-on by running:

```
yarn install
```

Start volto with:

```
yarn start
```

### Volto 18 and later

Add `aurora-project-title` to your `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "aurora-project-title": "*"
}
```

Add `aurora-project-title` to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const addons = ['aurora-project-title'];
```

If this package provides a Volto theme, and you want to activate it, then add the following to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const theme = 'aurora-project-title';
```

## Test installation

Visit http://localhost:3000/ in a browser, login, and check the awesome new features.


## Development

The development of this add-on is done in isolation using a new approach using pnpm workspaces and latest `mrs-developer` and other Volto core improvements.
For this reason, it only works with pnpm and Volto 18 (currently in alpha).


### Pre-requisites

-   [Node.js](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project.html#node-js)
-   [Make](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project.html#make)
-   [Docker](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project.html#docker)

Install and enable the latest Corepack. Corepack will resolve the pnpm version
pinned by this repository's `packageManager` field.

```shell
npm install --global corepack@latest
corepack enable
```


### Make convenience commands

Run `make help` to list the available commands.
